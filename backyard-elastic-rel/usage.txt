You will want to export the misp server details before running the flask script:

export MISP_URL='https://'
export MISP_KEY=''
export MISP_VERIFYCERT='False'

Then python3 misp_flask_app.py


The logstash conf file in in the logstash directory. Generally this file is placed in /etc/logstash/conf.d.

You can change test-tage in the conf file to retrieve events with specific tags in the misp server:

http://127.0.0.1:5001/misp/events/test-tag  

To test you can do curl http://127.0.0.1:5001/misp/<tag name>

Right now this setup does not scale for large scale event indexing.
